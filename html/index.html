					<h2>What is IH?</h2>
					<p id="main-info2-1">
						Idiopathic Hypersomnia (IH) is a neurological sleep disorder
						that can impact many aspects of a person’s life. This is a very
						rare disorder. IH often starts as a teenager or young adult and
						causes individuals to be excessively sleepy during the day even
						after a good or prolonged night’s sleep. Many have IH for many
						years without knowing it.

					<p id="main-info2-3">
						Oftentimes individuals are misdiagnosed as having narcolepsy
						because IH and narcolepsy present in similar ways. The diagnosis
						of IH requires ruling out more common sleep disorders. If an
						underlying cause of hypersomnia cannot be found, a diagnosis of
						IH may be made based on an individual’s symptoms and the results
						of sleep tests.

					<h2>Diagnosis.</h2>

				<div id="section2-4">
					<h2>Criteria for IH diagnosis.</h2>
					<ul id="main-info2-4">
						<li>
							Daily periods of excessive sleepiness for at least 3 months
						</li>
						<li>
							No evidence of cataplexy or sudden muscle weakness
						</li>
						<li>
							Results from a multiple sleep latency test (MSLT) show a
							sleep latency (time to fall asleep) of less than 8 minutes
							or a total sleep time of 11 or more hours.
						</li>
						<li>
							Characteristic measurements of how long it takes to reach the
							REM sleep stage
						</li>
						<li>
							Insufficient sleep syndrome is ruled out

						Since the cause of IH is unknown, the treatment is aimed at
						easing the symptoms that individuals have with this disorder.
						It is common practice to use medications that are known to be
						effective in people with narcolepsy and other neurologic/sleep
						disorders to treat the sleepiness associated with IH (this is
						called off-label use).

					<h2>Treatment.</h2>

						<h2>Treatment Options.</h2>
						<p id="main-info4-2">
							Medications may include stimulants such as: modafinil/amphetamine-
							like compounds, ADHD medications, antidepressants, and sedatives.
							The first U.S. FDA-approved treatment for IH, lower-sodium oxybate
							(or Xywav), was approved in August of 2021. Xywav is a medication
							taken at bedtime (and often with another dose later in the night)
							that promotes deep sleep and improved daytime sleepiness.

					<h3>How long have you known that you have IH?</h3>
					<p class="response-answers" id="response5-2-1">
						"I was diagnosed when I was 21 years old in September of 2016."
					</p>
					<h3 id="question5-2-2">What is it like living with IH?
						What are your day to day struggles?</h3>
					<p class="response-answers" id="response5-2-2">
						"Before I was diagnosed, living with IH meant having a constant,
						overwhelming desire to be asleep. It didn’t matter where I was
						or what I was doing - part of me always wanted to be sleeping.
						I think the biggest struggle I had was waking up in the mornings.
						A symptom of IH is sleep inertia, or sleep drunkenness, which
						makes it extremely hard to wake up in the mornings or after a
						nap. In the past, I would have at least 10 alarms set each
						morning and sleep inertia would cause me to either sleep right
						through the alarms or wake up long enough to turn them off with
						no memory of doing so."
					</p>
				</div>
				<div id="section5-3">
					<h3>What was the diagnosis process like?</h3>
					<p class="response-answers" id="response5-3-1">
						"I had a consultation appointment to talk to a doctor about the
						struggles I was having and my sleep habits. She then scheduled
						me for a sleep study a week later. I was hooked up to a bunch
						of wires on my face and chest and a tube up my nose and bedtime
						was 10pm. I was woken up at 7am and got the nose thing removed
						as well as some of the wires. The rest of the wires had to stay
						connected to me throughout the day for further testing. I got to
						sit in my room for about 2 hours before the nurse came back in
						and tucked me in for a 20 minute nap time. During this 20 minute
						 period they monitored how quickly I fell asleep, how long I stayed
						 asleep, and whether I entered the REM sleep cycle. This cycle was
						 repeated 3 more times before I got to leave for the day."
					</p>
					<p class="response-answers" id="response5-3-2">
						"I went back to the office another week later to receive my test
						results. The doctor explained that the average person takes eight
						minutes or longer to fall asleep after they’ve laid down - anything
						 less than eight minutes is considered abnormal. She then told me
						 that during my 4 naps, I fell asleep within 2-5 minutes each time
						 and stayed asleep until the nurse woke me up. Since I did not
						 enter the REM sleep cycle at any point during my naps, narcolepsy
						 was ruled out, but falling asleep as quickly and consistently as
						 I did meant there was still an issue. My doctor then explained
						 what IH is and that my sleepiness is still a medical issue but
						 there’s no definite reason as to why I am so sleepy."

				<div id="section5-4">
					<h3>What do most not know about IH?</h3>
					<p class="response-answers" id="response5-4-1">
						"That it exists."
					</p>
					<h3 id="question5-4-2"> What pushed you to receive medical help?</h3>
					<p class="response-answers" id="response5-4-2">
						"I slept a lot throughout my childhood. Even as a baby, my mom
						told me she had to call the doctor to make sure it was normal
						that I was sleeping as much as I was. Falling asleep in class
						was a pretty normal thing for me throughout highschool and college.
						When I started working, I would set alarms and take 20-30 minute naps
						during my lunch break everyday. But I finally looked into sleep
						clinics the summer of 2016 because I noticed myself dozing off at
						red lights on my morning drive to work."
