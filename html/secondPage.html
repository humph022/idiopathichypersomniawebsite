					A Multicenter Study of the Efficacy and Safety of JZP-258 in the
					Treatment of Idiopathic Hypersomnia (IH) With an Open-label Safety
					Extension
				</li>
				<li class="second-indent">
					This is a study of the efficacy and safety of JZP-258, an oxybate
					mixed-salts oral solution being developed as a low sodium
					alternative product for Xyrem (commonly used to treat narcolepsy,
					but also sometimes used for those with IH).

				<li class="bold-list-title">
					Sodium Oxybate in Idiopathic Hypersomnia
				</li>
				<li class="second-indent">
					This study evaluates of the efficacy of sodium oxybate on
					excessive daytime sleepiness using the Epworth sleepiness
					scale over 8 weeks.
				</li>
				<li class="bold-list-title">
					A Phase 3 Study to Assess the Safety and Efficacy of Pitolisant
					in Adult Patients With Idiopathic Hypersomnia
				</li>
				<li class="second-indent">
					The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety
					and efficacy of pitolisant (a drug designed to promote
					wakefulness) compared with placebo in treating excessive
					daytime sleepiness (EDS) in patients with IH agre 18 or above.
				</li>
				<li class="bold-list-title">
					Modafinil Versus Amphetamines for the Treatment of Narcolepsy
					Type 2 and Idiopathic Hypersomnia
				</li>
				<li class="second-indent">
					This study will evaluate which medication works better to
					improve sleepiness. The researchers will also see which
					medication is better for other symptoms including difficulty
					waking up and difficulty thinking, as well as seeing which
					medication causes fewer side effects. Finally, this study will
					see if any information about patients (such as age or sleep
					study features) predicts responding better to one medication
					or the other.
